Success in the World Cup

Before we began this project, we carefully thought on why the United States Men’s National Soccer Team did not qualify for 
the 2018 World Cup. We analyzed what makes a national soccer team successful in the World Cup and determined our 
definition of success, any team who has at least qualified for the Quarter Final stage consecutively for the past four 
tournaments. We analyzed World Cup datasets and found seven national teams that were deemed successful. We evaluated four 
common statistics from these seven national teams that led them to consistent success throughout the previous four World Cups. 
These statistics were goal average per game, pass accuracy, shot accuracy, and offensive pass accuracy.

Next, we obtained same statistics from the United States Men’s National Soccer Team to compare and determine the distinction 
between successful and unsuccessful teams. Although, we found USA’s pass accuracy to be similar between the seven teams, the 
offensive pass accuracy was significantly lower. Given the data provided, USA’s goal average per game and shot accuracy were 
sufficient enough to qualify for the World Cup and be deemed successful in the tournament. 

Based on our analysis, the USMNT does show potential to regularly qualify for the World Cups in the future given the increase of offensive plays toward goal.

--All statistics from the successful teams have been obtained from the 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018 World Cups and since January 24, 2010 for the United States Men’s National Team.
